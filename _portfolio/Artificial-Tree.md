This is a project is currently in devlopment conjuction with the Srebnik Lab in Biomedical Engineering and the Forestry deparment in UBC. 
I am working on a simulated module where I will be analyzing the properties of water cavitation of cellulose membrane. The simulation is done with [LAMMPS](https://www.lammps.org/#gsc.tab=0). 

I am currently simulating the cellulose membrane using Cellulose IÎ± [^1]. The cellulose[^1] cif file was converted in a lammps data file using OPLS force fields. The water used is TIP4P. The main code used to run the lammp simulation is at [main.lmp](https://gitfront.io/r/janellecheung/QHBtzxc8cMTW/Compiled-projects/tree/Artifical%20Tree/). 

Here is an the current illustration of the simulation: two layers of cellulose sandwich between water molecules.
