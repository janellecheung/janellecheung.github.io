I was interested in a quick data analyst project to pratice my skills. I picked R due to its kniting and markdown function and its plentiful APIs. I was furthermore interested in looking at some GEOspatial data so I pulled out data from Cancensus API, processed the data, and [interactively visualized](https://rpubs.com/janelle_cheung/incomeacrossCanada2021) the median income across Canada. From the visulization, the couple regions that seems to be desolate a higher income.

I tested the hypothesis for correlation between population size and median income using pearon's produce-moment correlation test after transforming the data - finding a positive corrlation. 

I published it on RPubs: https://rpubs.com/janelle_cheung/incomeacrossCanada2021 .
