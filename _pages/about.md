I have completed my BSc in Combined Biochemistry and Chemistry in the University of British Columbia and currently looking for graduate studies. 

# Selected research experiences 
- Developed a [DNA-based therapeutics](https://tinyurl.com/7dzh6ym4) (oligotherapeutic) to target Hodgkin Lymphoma in Dr. Steven Hallam at UBC, enaging in multiple of research conference and entepership competitions. 
- Engaged in translational research with Dr. Bruce Vallance, focusing on culturing and maintenance of intestinal organoids derived from pediatric and adult somatic intestinal stem cells.
- Collaborating on research projectsÂ at TRIUMFÂ under the supervision of Dr. Valery Radchenko, where I explored the innovative application of [siderophores for radiolabeling therapeutics](https://tinyurl.com/h57pud3s).
- Published a paper onÂ [Comparing Public Sentiment Toward COVID-19 Vaccines Across Canadian Cities: Analysis of Comments on Reddit](https://www.jmir.org/2021/9/e32685/), by using NLP on reddit comments and Decision Trees to associate sentiment values from labelled twitter sentiment scores.

# Some side projects that I have been working on

|Project | Description |
|:---------- | ----------- |
|[Artificial Tree](/_portfolio/portfolio-1.md)| I am using LAMMPS to simulate water cavitation within a cellulose membrane. |
|[Median income across Canada](/_portfolio/Median.md)| I used R to analyze the Canadian census in 2021 and income trends, through graphical visualization and  Pearson's correlations to determine statsitcal coorelation between population and median income. |
|[Particle Movement - Visualization with Python and VMD](https://gitfront.io/r/janellecheung/QHBtzxc8cMTW/Compiled-projects/blob/LJs-fluid/LJfluid.md) | Utilized Python to simulate particles in a box. I analzed the simulation and generate a xyz file to visualize using VMD. |
|[Predicting and visualization of Ocean acidification](https://gitfront.io/r/janellecheung/QHBtzxc8cMTW/Compiled-projects/blob/Ocean/Ocean.md)| Analyzed ocean data from NOAA and compared machine learning models and look at models to predict ocean acidification |
